## Introduction

The Python Course aims to guide beginners and intermediate learners through the basics to the advanced aspects of Python. Whether you are a software developer, data scientist, or just interested in programming, this course will provide you with the essential knowledge and hands-on experience to start writing Python code effectively.

## Course Structure

The course is divided into modules, each covering a specific topic with relevant code examples, exercises, and solutions. The modules build upon each other, so we recommend following them in order.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of programming concepts (variables, loops, functions)
- A computer with **Python 3.7+** installed

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anas-arafa/python-course.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd python-course
   ```

3. Install required dependencies (if any). For example, using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Each module contains a `README.md` explaining the topic, key concepts, and exercises.
2. Navigate to the module directory you wish to work on and follow the instructions.
3. Run Python scripts with:

   ```bash
   python <script_name>.py
   ```
